    <h2>What is web?</h2>
    <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a></strong>,
      commonly known as the Web,is an information system where documents and other web resources
      are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
      (URLs, such as <a href="https://www.example.com/">https://www.example.com/)</a>, which may be interlinked
      by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of
      the WWW are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser
      and are published by a software application called a web server.
